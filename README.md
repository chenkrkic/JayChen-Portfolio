# JayChen-Portfolio

Welcome to my first developer portfolio

This portfolio was built with HTML and styled by CSS.


## HTML Part

I used HTML to built the Portfolio page's content/ layout. 

Creating navigation buttons, and sectioning the contents with basic HTML skill. 

Adding images to make page more interactive. 


## CSS Part

This page was styled by CSS only.

Adjusting the font-text and sections with CSS resizing skills. 

Adding padding to different sections and images to put them in the desirable position. 

Applying some media query tools to make the page applicable to different size screens. 



No a nice looking one, but I have applied all the skills I knew to it. 

Please feel free to make a comment/ suggestion, so that I can present something better next time.
